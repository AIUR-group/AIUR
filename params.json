The AI starts a game with a \"mood\" randomly picked up among 5 moods, dictating some behaviors (aggressive, fast expand, macro-game, ...). In addition, some other choices (productions, timing attacks, early aggressions, ...) are also taken under random conditions.\r\n\r\nLearning is an essential part of AIUR. For this, it uses persistent I/O files system to record which moods are efficient against a given opponent, in order to modify the probability distribution for the mood selection.  \r\n\r\n## What's new since AIIDE/CIG 2013 (AIUR 2.1)?\r\n\r\n  * New mood selection policy: AIUR uses now an epsilon-greedy algorithm.\r\n  * New old mood: The DefensiveMood is selectable again at the beginning of a game (was disabled since AIUR v2.0). AIUR has thus 6 selectable starting moods.\r\n  *  Rush mood changed into a rush DT.\r\n  * Implement an off-line learning feature: You can now train AIUR against a given opponent and use that learning for further games, like during tournaments.\r\n  * Improve the Cannon rush pathfinding. \r\n\r\n## Scientific papers\r\n\r\n  * Santiago Ontañón, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alberto Uriarte, Florian Richoux, David Churchill and Mike Preuss.
