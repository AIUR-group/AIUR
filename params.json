The AI starts a game with a \"mood\" randomly picked up among 5 moods, dictating some behaviors (aggressive, fast expand, macro-game, ...). In addition, some other choices (productions, timing attacks, early aggressions, ...) are also taken under random conditions.\r\n\r\nLearning is an essential part of AIUR. For this, it uses persistent I/O files system to record which moods are efficient against a given opponent, in order to modify the probability distribution for the mood selection.  \r\n\r\n## What's new since AIIDE/CIG 2012 (AIUR 2.0)?\r\n\r\n  * We now save if, against a given opponent, the selected mood led or not to a victory according to the map size (i.e., the number of starting points). AIUR can now realize that a given mood is, for instance, efficient on a small map but not on a bigger one. This helps the bot to sharply select good moods, even if this selection is still random according to a distribution modified by our saved information.\r\n  * Modify the Agressive mood into a fast drop zealot.\r\n  * Add a heuristic to focus enemy units during attacks (to be improved in fact).\r\n  * Improve the rush Photon to be more stealthy.\r\n\r\n## Scientific papers\r\n\r\n  * Santiago Ontañón, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alberto Uriarte, Florian Richoux, David Churchill and Mike Preuss.
